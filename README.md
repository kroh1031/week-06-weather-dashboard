# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

[My Weather Dashboard Website!](https://kroh1031.github.io/week-06-weather-dashboard/)  
For this week's homework, I created a weather dashboard by retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of my own.  
The purpose of building this project was to allow users to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that they can plan a trip accordingly.  
I used local storage so that the searched cities persist even when the page is refreshed.

## Installation

The steps that I took in order to deploy my website:

1. First, I used the git add, git commit, and git push commands to save and push my code to my GitHub repository.
2. Then, I navigated into my GitHub repository's Settings tab.
3. From the settings page, I scrolled down to the GitHub Pages section and selected the master branch as my source.
4. After doing so, I was finally able to get the URL for my now deployed website.

## Usage

To use my website, search for a city name and the current and future weather conditions for that city will be displayed on the page.  
Then, click on any of the previously searched cities in the search history to again be presented with the according current and future weather conditions for the city.  
Finally, click on the clear button to get rid of the search history.
